Python Calculator App

This Application was developed using Tkinter to build the GUI.

Functionality:

    It contains the standard mode of operations of any calculator, 
    it also uses more advance operations that used libraries such as math and numpy. 

    List of functionalities:
    1. Addition
    2. Substraction
    3. Multiplication
    4. Division
    5. Pi
    6. 1/x
    7. Square
    8. Square root
    9. Cube
    10. Cube root
    11. 10^x
    12. Factorial
    13. Log10
    14. e^x
    15. Clear
    16. +/-
    17. Percent

How does it work?

    The simple operators, highlighted in orange are divide, multiply,
    add, and subtract. You select your chosen number then your operator, 
    and then your next chosen number and select "=", do find your answer.

    Example: press the following buttons. "2", "+", "2", "=". You will get "4" which then represents your first chosen number.

    For the advanced operators, highlighted in dark and light grey are 1/x, square, 
    square root, cube, cube root, 10^x, factorial, Log10, e^x, +/-, %. You select
    a number to represent X for the button, then select your operator.

    Example: press the following buttons. "5", "x^2". It will evaluate for you and you will receive "25"

    Exceptions: 2 buttons that are colored dark and light grey are exceptions to this.
    "Pi", which it a number and would act as your number chosen. "AC" which will clear
    current and total expression.
